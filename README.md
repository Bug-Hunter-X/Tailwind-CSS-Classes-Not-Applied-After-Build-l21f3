# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied After Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply after the build process, specifically in the production environment.  The issue does not manifest during development.

## Bug Description

The problem lies in the post-build process. Tailwind generates the CSS correctly during development, but the production build omits necessary CSS rules, resulting in the styles not being applied.  This can be caused by various factors, including misconfigurations in build pipelines, incorrect usage of purge/content options in Tailwind's configuration, or interactions with other plugins or build tools.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the development build (e.g. `npm run dev` ).  Observe that the Tailwind CSS classes are working correctly.
3. Run the production build (e.g. `npm run build`).
4. Examine the production-built CSS files. Notice the absence of certain Tailwind CSS rules that should have been included based on usage in the JavaScript files.
5. Deploy the application and view in the production environment. The missing styles will result in the application rendering incorrectly.

## Solution

The solution will depend on the specific cause. This may involve:

* Verifying the `purge` or `content` option in the Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.js`)  to ensure that it correctly identifies the JavaScript files containing the classes.
* Double-checking for conflicts with other plugins or build tools.
* Ensuring correct paths in the build process.
* Updating Tailwind CSS to the latest version or using a known good configuration.
